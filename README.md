## Remove likes from Facebook notifications

Right now this is just Javascript to be run as a bookmarklet. 
Eventually I hope to change it into a Chrome extension, but for now I will be happy if I get it to work correctly.

To create a bookmarklet, in Chrome:

 1. Open up bookmark manager.
 1. In the folder where you want the new bookmarklet, under the Organize pulldown, choose Add Page ...
 1. Call the bookmarklet whatever you want, highlight the entire functionality_jswidget_min.js file, 
and paste into the URL field.

I have a bookmark subdir with a few JS widgets.
